## Why ?

I'm using [blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) as my DNS Sink Hole. It's pretty great. Although one problem I faced time to time is whenever I restart to update some configuration, it downloads all the files again. Which is not bad if you've good internet. But in my case it sometime took 10min to complete the download of all the Firebog's ticked list. After some testing I found files hosted on github downloaded pretty fast so here it is. All firebog's ticked list in to one giant file.

Script scheduled to auto run every 6 hours but github scheduled workflows tends to get delayed.
